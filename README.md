# Why:
- Runelite removed the window opacity option in [this commit](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/commit/64595bcf4d1f48858771574da60f0a8d20826389).
- The [previous script](https://gist.github.com/Zazcallabah/8277d6762dad93dfb684cb52d579518e) was a GitHub Gist and last updated eight years ago.
- I don't want to remember the RuneLite command when someone wants this script..
